## MATLAB CODE:

- **MATLAB** is a folder with all the scripts written to generate plots shown in the results. Each of these is part of the 'simulation':
    - Demand_Profile.m is the script which generates a demand profile. This script is integrated into the MC simulation to reduce runtime of importing CSV data. The main purpose is therefore just to produce the plot.
    - The password for the email address in failsafe.py has been *removed* for security reasons. Please enter your own gmail address and password credentials
    - MQ4duino.ino is the script used to collected MQ4 sensor values
    

 
## Bin Packing Algorithm:

- **Car Packing Problem.ipynb** is a Jupyter notebook file containing cells which process the data and use a bin packing algorithm to minimise bin sizes.
